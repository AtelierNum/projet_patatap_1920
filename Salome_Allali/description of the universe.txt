I created my patatap on the theme of electro music with short and repetitive sounds. My Patatap can be similar to a Launchpad because you can create music and rhythm by playing with letters.
For the colors, I wanted to stay in an electro universe, a world of nightlife and festivals. My colors are blue, green and dark green on a night blue background, they highlight my animations that flash and rhythm my patatap
